# Flashbook
It will be awesome device for writing, reading and drawing. It would change the way of writing. 
## Why is the Project?
Are you a Student? Are you an Engineer? Are you a Doctor? Are you a Lawyer? Are you an Accountant? Are you an Artist? Whatever is your field; you are using or would have used notebooks for your works. And also a college student use approximately 15 pages for writing and 30 pages for photocopy, so total 45 pages per day. 8,000 A4-sized papers can be made by sacrificing one green tree. So, one student cut one tree in 177 days. Talking about engineering college, they have four years of bachelor’s course, in this duration he or she might have cut 8.25 trees and needed 5,000 litre (if reusable water) or 98,550 litre (if non-reusable water) of water in their four years duration. And also students spend approx 1000 INR on photocopy, notebook and other stationery. So, in the span of four years, the total reaches 12000 INR.
## What is a Solution?
As our main objective here is to find a solution which is eco friendly. So we need to make “Something” which helps to achieve our objective and also “Cost Effective”. A solution is that to make something like screen which is permanent and using finger gestures or something like stylus to write on it. First of all it is going to take place of existing conventional notebook, so “Flashbook” should feel like conventional book.

## Latency of Screen Response
We get latency of 500 milliseconds while using LCD.
